```

The purpose of this README is to demonstrate using a custom *csl* file and *yaml* bibliography to change the formatting of citations in RMarkdown documents.

## Citation Style Language

The file *my-cool-style.csl* contains a simple custom citation style that was generated using a [visual editor](http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor).

The custom style specifies that:

- the citation should contain only the citation-number in superscript.
- the bibligraphy entries are prefixed by a left bracket, suffixed by a right bracket, delimted by a forward slash.

## YAML Bibliography

Instead of using a common bibTex file to record bibliographic entries, this project uses a YAML file. The *biblio.yaml* file is machine and human readable and allows for custom field entries that are not typically allowed by bibTex. 

## Example Usage

This is an R Markdown document [@item1]. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents [@WatsonCrick1953]. For more details [@fenner2012a] on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
